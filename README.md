## 🚀 Overview  
**LinguaGenius** is a modern, lightweight language-learning app inspired by Duolingo — built from scratch on **Sunday morning, 2nd November 2025**, as a personal challenge to reimagine how interactive learning could be simplified using clean UX and smart logic.  

Users can choose from multiple languages (English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Korean, and Mandarin) and start quick, quiz-based lessons designed to make learning engaging, visual, and rewarding.
